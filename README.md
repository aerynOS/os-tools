# 🛠️ OS Tools - Modern System State Management

## We do not accept contributions authored using genAI/LLM chatbots/agents

Our stance is that we are here to help train people's minds and skills. As an analogy, it would defeat the purpose if you brought an industrial robot with you to the gym so it could lift weights for you.

For more details, consult our [Contribution guidelines](https://github.com/aerynOS/os-tools?tab=contributing-ov-file#llm-contributions).

## 📦 Core Tools

This repository provides two powerful Rust-based tools for managing `.stone` packages, the native package format for aerynOS:

- **moss**: Advanced package & system state manager with atomic transactions and content deduplication
- **boulder**: Modern package building tool with containerized builds and intelligent package splitting

## 🔧 Technical Overview

### .stone Package Format
The `.stone` format is a structured binary package format designed for modern, rolling-release systems. It features:

- Explicit versioning for seamless format changes
- `zstd` compression for optimal storage
- Content-addressable storage via `xxhash`
- Smart payload separation:
  - 📋 Metadata: Package info and licensing with strong typing
  - 🗂️ Layout: Filesystem structure definitions
  - 📑 Index: Content payload access mapping
  - 📦 Content: Deduplicated file storage

### System Architecture
- Content-addressable `/usr` with atomic updates via `renameat2`
- Private store and roots in `/.moss`
- Container-based transaction triggers
- Full USR merge compliance
- Stateless system design with clear separation of OS and local system configuration
- Quick system rollbacks through atomic operations

### Boulder Features
- YAML-based recipe format (`stone.yaml`, [`KDL`](https://kdl.dev) coming soon ❤️)
- Automatic subpackage splitting
- Automatic provider emission (e.g. `soname()`) and dependency use
- Uniform format for repos, manifests and packages
- Integrated build sandboxing (also supports rootless builds)
- Advanced compiler optimization profiles
- Support for architecture-specific tuning

**Note**: Using latest Rust via `rustup` is recommended.

## 🚀 Onboarding

```bash
# clone the aerynOS os-tools repo somewhere reasonable
mkdir -pv ~/Projects/aerynos/
cd ~/Projects/aerynos/
git clone https://github.com/aerynOS/os-tools.git
cd os-tools/

# Install a few prerequisites (this how you'd do it on aerynOS)
sudo moss pkg add rust binutils glibc-devel linux-headers clang bsdtar-static cpio

    # remember to add ~/.cargo/bin to your $PATH if this is how you installed rustfmt
cargo install rustfmt

cargo install typos-cli --locked

# from inside the moss clone, this will build boulder and moss
# and install them to ${HOME}/.local/bin/ by default
just get-started

# boulder and moss rely on so-called subuid and subgid support.
# IFF you do not already have this set up for your ${USER} in /etc/subuid and /etc/subuid
# you might want to do something similar to this:
sudo touch /etc/sub{uid,gid}
sudo usermod --add-subuids 1000000-1065535 --add-subgids 1000000-1065535 root
sudo usermod --add-subuids 1065536-1131071 --add-subgids 1065536-1131071 ${USER}
```

**NB:** If you want to build .stones with boulder on your _non-aerynOS_ host system, you will need to specify the
location of the boulder data files (which live in ${HOME}/.local/share/boulder if you used `just get-started` like above):

```bash
alias boulder="${HOME}/.local/bin/boulder --data-dir=${HOME}/.local/share/boulder/ --config-dir=${HOME}/.config/boulder/ --moss-root=${HOME}/.cache/boulder/"
```

## 📚 Documentation

See [aerynos.com/aerynos](https://aerynos.com/aerynos/).

## 🧪 Experiment

**NB:** Remember to use the `-D aosroot/` argument to specify a root directory, otherwise moss will happily
eat your current operating system.

```bash
just get-started

# create the aosroot/ directory
mkdir -pv aosroot/

# Add the unstable repo
moss -D aosroot/ repo add unstable https://cdn.aerynos.dev --root-index channel=main,version=stream/unstable

# List packages
moss -D aosroot/ pkg list --available

# Install something
moss -D aosroot/ pkg add systemd bash libx11-32bit
```
